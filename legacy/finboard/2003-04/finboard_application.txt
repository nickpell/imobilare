Student Group:   Imobilare

Budget Defense


     Imobilare is a group devoted to the promotion and preservation of hip-hop culture.  Affectionately referred to as "MIT's hip-hop" club, Imobilare is centered around an appreciation for the 4 main elements of hip-hop:  DJ'ing, freestyling, graffiti (for artistry, not vandalism), and breakdancing.  We have bi-weekly meetings where you can see a diverse sampling of the MIT community coming together to celebrate a culture that has grown to become a very visible part of today's society.  Since Imobilare is still a young organization, our membership represents some elements more strongly than others.  In particular, breakdancing, due mostly to its visual appeal, has been the portion of the club that generates the most interest.  We do have dj's, freestylers, and graffiti artists, but the breakdancing portion of our club is unique because of the frequency with which it draws in new members.

Other than that, since our dj's and graffiti artists have their own equipment, and our freestylers need no equipment, the budget outlined below mostly concerns items related to breakdancing.  


1. DJing/Breakdancing Event -- Next term we plan to throw a large event where turntablism (DJing) and breakdancing will be featured.  This event will be open to the entire MIT community.

2. & 3.  Dance surface and padding  -- in order to perform safely and effectively, breakdancers require a semi-slick padded surface.  It is also necessary that the surface be light and flexible so that we can move it from place to place as necessary.  Linoleum is the surface of choice and a layer of thin carpeting underneath would provide the required padding and stability.  These surfaces need to be replaced every few months due to the wear and tear that accumulates.

4.  TV/VCR combo -- we need something to play our instructional videos on.

5.  Copies, posters, etc.  -- we make posters to promote our practices, performances, etc.


Thank you
